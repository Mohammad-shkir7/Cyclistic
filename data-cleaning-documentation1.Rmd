## Introduction

<font size="3">The following document contains data cleaning steps and code snippets our team wrote in order to transform Cyclistic data set to ROCCC.</font>

### Importing dataset

Note: making new table then importing data using PgAdmin4

```{sql raw_data, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
-- DROP TABLE year_2019_raw
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS year_2019_raw
(
	trip_id varchar(15) PRIMARY KEY,
	start_time timestamp,
	end_time timestamp,
	bikeid varchar(10),
	trip_duration varchar(20),
	from_station_id varchar(10),
	from_station_name varchar(60),
	to_station_id varchar(10),
	to_station_name varchar(60),
	user_type varchar(15),
	gender varchar(10),
	birth_year numeric(4,0)
)
;
```


### Handling missing values

Note: We have found that only *'birth_year'* and *'gender'* tables have **NULL** values.

```{sql missing_values, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
SELECT
	* 
FROM 
	year_2019_raw
WHERE 
	 birth_year IS NULL 
	OR gender IS NULL 
;
```

### Handling logically incorrect values

Note: We have agreed to removed *birth year* values less than '1900'.

```{sql logically_incorrect, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
SELECT
	* 
FROM 
	year_2019_raw
WHERE 1=1
	AND birth_year < 1900 
;
```

Note: Removing records where rent's <ins>start time</ins> **bigger** than <ins>end time.</ins>

```{sql logically_incorrect2, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
SELECT
	* 
FROM 
	year_2019_raw
WHERE 1=1
	and start_time > end_time
;

```

### Handling incorrect data types

Note: Here we're removing comma and period from 'trip_duration'.

```{sql incorrect_types, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
SELECT
	trip_duration,
	POSITION('.' IN trip_duration),
	REPLACE (trip_duration, ',',''),
	LEFT(REPLACE (trip_duration, ',',''), POSITION('.' IN REPLACE (trip_duration, ',',''))-1) 
FROM	
	year_2019_raw
;


```

### Adding new columns

Note: Adding 'day_of_week'.

```{sql day_of_week, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(dow FROM start_time) AS day_of_week, -- 0 = sunday, 6 = saturday
	* 
FROM 
	year_2019
;
```

### Putting it all together!

Note: making new table that contains filtered data.

```{sql final_table, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
CREATE TABLE year_2019 AS 
SELECT	
	trip_id,
	start_time,
	end_time,
	CAST (bikeid AS float),
	CAST (LEFT(REPLACE (trip_duration, ',',''), POSITION('.' IN REPLACE (trip_duration, ',',''))-1) AS float) AS trip_duration_mm,
	CAST (from_station_id AS float),
	from_station_name,
	CAST (to_station_id AS float),
	to_station_name,
	user_type,
	gender,
	birth_year,
	EXTRACT(dow FROM start_time) AS day_of_week -- 0 = sunday, 6 = saturday
FROM
	year_2019_raw yr 
WHERE 1=1 
	AND birth_year > 1900 
	AND birth_year IS NOT NULL 
	AND gender IS NOT NULL 
	AND start_time < end_time
;	
```
